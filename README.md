# DatabaseConnector
DB connector 
Windows application for connecting to a database.
As an example, connect to MySQL.
An application written in Visual Basic in C #.
You can change "Server=xxx;User id=xxx;persistsecurityinfo=True;database=xxxx;port=xxx;password=xxx" for your needs, just edit MainWindow.xaml.cs and rebuild.
As an example I used a connection with MySQL database- MySQL Workbench.
